# Kaun Banega Crorepati Game
## Overview
This the code for the famous "Kaun Banega Crorepati (Who wants to be a Millionaire)" game. It's a simple quiz game with the player (user) having to answer multiple choice questions to move forward. The player has three lifelines at the start viz. audience poll, fifty-fifty and swap the question at his disposal.

## Tech stack
We have developed the game using C++ in our back-end implementation and GLUT and IL libraries for our front-end implementation and openGL for rendering.

### Update
#### April 20, 2017
There are still a number of bugs in our application. Also there is no modularity in our program. But this will do for now. Feel free to use our code.
P.S:- To anybody using this code, the buttons will probably not work on your computer. For them to work, you'll have to set the coordinates in the entire 1.cpp according to your screen.
