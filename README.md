Kaun Banega Crorepati Game
This the code for the famous Kaun Banega Crorepati (Who wants to be a Millionaire) game.
It's a simple quiz game with the user having to answer multiple choice questions to move forward.
The user has three lifelines viz. audience poll, fifty fifty and, swap the question to his disposal.

We have developed the game using C++ in our back-end implementation and GLUT and IL libraries for our front-end implementation and openGL for rendering.

So, this is the final kbc game.
There are still a lot (a lot) of bugs in our application.
Also there is no modularity in our program.
But this will do for now.
Feel free to use our code.
P.S:- To anybody using this code, the buttons will probably not work on your computer. For them to work, you'll have to set the coordinates in the entire 1.cpp according to your screen.
